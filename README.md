This repository contains code for the Vision task for the NNTI Project, Winter Semester 2020/21. <br/><br/>

Task 1: <br/>
Simple object segmentation on the PASCAL VOC dataset of 21 classes.<br/><br/>
We ran the complete notebook with our best configurations before uploading it, and thus all the outputs can be seen directly form the notebook.
In case, the notebook doesn't open in github, please try downloading it and opening it locally.

Task 2:<br/>
Implementation of Recurrent Residual Convolutional Neural Network (R2U-Net)<br/>
Dataset: Cityscapes (19 Fine classes)<br/><br/>

Task 3:<br/>
Using other methodologies to improve results from Task 2.<br/>
(Architectures implemented: DeepLabV3, UNet3+) <br/>
Dataset: Cityscapes (19 Fine classes)

The Directory Structure is as follows:

CV_Task_1.ipynb contain the complete notebook for Task 1.

The modules for Tasks 2 and 3, along with the implemented notebooks are present in the folder 'Task_2_3'. The code is implemented in the notebooks CV_Task_2.ipynb, CV_Task_3_DeepLabV3.ipynb, and CV_Task_3_UNet3Plus.ipynb respectively.

Sample predictions with the original images and ground truths are present in the 'Visualisations' folder.

This repository also contains the project report with the description, results, and analysis.
